# Considerations when using AI to build this app

## Rules

You will find a set of rules `.mdc` files in the `.cursor/rules` folder. You can adapt these rules to suit your app and coding style. These can also be adapted to use with other LLM-assisted IDEs or tools.

## Open SaaS and Wasp Docs

You can find LLM-friendly documentation here:
- [Open SaaS Docs - LLMs.txt][https://docs.opensaas.sh/llms.txt]
- [Open SaaS Docs - LLMs-full.txt][https://docs.opensaas.sh/llms-full.txt]
- [Wasp Docs - LLMs.txt][https://wasp.sh/llms.txt]
- [Wasp Docs - LLMs-full.txt][https://wasp.sh/llms-full.txt]

Add these to your AI-assisted IDE settings or mention specific urls in your chat sessions with the LLM. For example, if you're trying to add a new Auth provider to your app, you can go to the llms.txt url, find the relevant raw doc url, and pass it to the LLM to help you.

## Example Prompts

See [prompts.md](prompts.md) for some example prompts you can use to help you get started when creating a new app from a fresh template.
